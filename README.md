# Poke App
What the difference is between all these different frontend frameworks / libraries? Glad you asked!

I've created a simple PokeApi application written in:
-  Angularjs 
-  React w/ TS


## Dependencies
Both sample applications use 
-  [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/) RESTful api
-  [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling.
